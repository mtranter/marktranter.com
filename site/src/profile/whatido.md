### What I Do
I have over 12 years experience as an engineer. Six of those have been involved in application design and system architecture. I have a passion for non-dogmatic agile delivery, including TDD/BDD and CI/CD.

I have 4 years experience in Data Engineering, predominantly with Kafka and Kafka Streams.

I'm fluent in Scala, C#, Java, JavaScript, and some Haskell.

I have 4 years of DevOps experience, training teams with the "You wrote it, you run it" culture. I use Terraform, CloudFormation, AWS and GCP.

I have reasonable front end skills with strong Javascript (Angular 1.0, Aurelia, jQuery), HTML and CSS. But I am NOT a designer.
