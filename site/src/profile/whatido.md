### What I Do
I have over 10 years experience as an engineer. Around 4 of those have been involved in application design and system architecture. I have a passion for agile delivery, and architectures that are as simple as they can be, but no simpler.

I like moving data around. The latest in data streaming platforms coupled with simple Kappa Architectures offer opportunities to move and analyse data at volume, in real time and with an ease that I find really exciting.

I love breaking down complex problems into simple abstractions. I love discovering a cost effective business solution rather than an expensive technical one. And vice versa.

I'm into languages. I'm fluent in C#, Scala, Java, JavaScript, and English. For fun I dabble in Haskell & Spanish. I like geeking out with the type systems of Haskell and Scala but also enjoy the pragmatic nature & rapid time-to-market potentials of dynamic languages like JavaScript and Clojure.

I like talking load balancing strategies, NAT Gateways, split DNS and Kubernetes/Swarm/ECS or Mesos with the ops team, as well as the latest in SASS vs LESS vs Stylus or what game changing JS framework has been released this week with the front end guys.
